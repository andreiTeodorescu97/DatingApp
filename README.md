# DatingApp
This is a personal project that represents a dating app made to improve my Angular and .NET 5 knowledge. \n
I made this application using .NET Core 5 and Angular 11 and I tried to implement some standard features for this kind of applications. \n
The platform is made of a Web Api which is consumed by a separate client application made in Angular. \n
Some of the most interesting features are:
o Database operations using Entity Framework and Auto-Mapper
o PostgreSQL database \n
o Microsoft Identity authentication
o Photos upload in Cloudinary (a cloud storage for photos)
o Live messaging system for registered users made with SignalR library
o Deployment in Heroku (because it was free)
o You can access the app here: https://datingappandrei.herokuapp.com/
