# DatingApp
This is a personal project that represents a dating app made to improve my Angular and .NET 5 knowledge. <br />
I made this application using .NET Core 5 and Angular 11 and I tried to implement some standard features for this kind of applications. <br />
The platform is made of a Web Api which is consumed by a separate client application made in Angular. <br />
Some of the most interesting features are: <br />
o Database operations using Entity Framework and Auto-Mapper <br />
o PostgreSQL database <br />
o Microsoft Identity authentication <br />
o Photos upload in Cloudinary (a cloud storage for photos) <br />
o Live messaging system for registered users made with SignalR library <br />
o Deployment in Heroku (because it was free) <br />
o You can access the app here: https://dating-app-bucharest.fly.dev// <br />
